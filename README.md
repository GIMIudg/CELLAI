# CELLAI: CELLular Analysis and Artificial Intelligence

CELLAI is a Python toolbox/library developed by our research group to support cellular analysis and artificial intelligence in the field of metabolic engineering. Our focus is on personalized medicine, anti-ageing studies, and intelligent farming practices.

## Features

- Comprehensive tools for analyzing cellular data and conducting artificial intelligence-driven research.
- Customizable machine learning algorithms for personalized medicine research.
- Cutting-edge methods for anti-ageing studies and biomarker discovery.
- Advanced data analysis and visualization tools for intelligent farming practices.

## Getting Started

To get started with CELLAI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the various modules and functionalities available in the library.
4. Check out our documentation and examples for detailed usage instructions.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use CELLAI:

1. Personalized Medicine:
   ```python
   # Import the personalized medicine module
   from cellai.personalized_medicine import CustomMLModel

   # Create a custom machine-learning model
   model = CustomMLModel()

   # Train the model on personalized medicine data
   model.train(data)

   # Make predictions for new patient samples
   predictions = model.predict(new_samples)

2. Anti-Aging Studies:
  ```python
  # Import the anti-aging module
  from cellai.anti_aging import BiomarkerDiscovery

  # Discover potential biomarkers for anti-aging research
  biomarkers = BiomarkerDiscovery.analyze(data)

3. Intelligent Farming:
  ```python
  # Import the intelligent farming module
  from cellai.intelligent_farming import CropPrediction

  # Predict crop yields using AI-driven models
  crop_yields = CropPrediction.predict(data)
